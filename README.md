# PegMii
Implements Pegasus exploit targeting Wii U 

Currently unfinished. At this point, only runs inside JSC due to placeholder gc() function, does not finalize r/w primitives, etc. 
However, I figured I should have the code published and documented since I've been streaming dev anyway. If you're interested in watching the progress, join me for the dev progress at twitch.tv/hedgeberg tuesday + thursday @ 8 PM EST or sunday @ 2 PM EST. 
Please note: I started this not knowing any javascript at all. I have 0 doubt there are some major issues/standards violations, please let me know if I made any mistakes.


Thanks to:
All my software-oriented friends at the reswitched team: SciresM, Daeken, Misson20k, OgniK and the rest. 
LiveOverflow who did a much better documentation of this. I haven't actually read his code but I know folks love it and I know that I'm getting at least some second hand info. Recommend checking his tutorials out, they're far cleaner than this. 
jam1garner, kitlith, and stuckpixel for the live help and rubber duck debugging.
